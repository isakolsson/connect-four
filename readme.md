# Connect Four vs Alpha-beta pruning
This project is based upon my tic-tac-toe project where I used a Minimax algorithm to make an unbeatable computer opponent. Connect Four has exponentially way more different combinations than tic-tac-toe and it was, therefore, impossible to go through all possible outcomes of the game, 11 rounds in advance are possible in a few seconds with my unoptimized use of the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm. Using the Minimax algorithm that number was around 8.
